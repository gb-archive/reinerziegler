Modification of a Bung GB Doctor Card 16Mbit to 64Mbit
======================================================

Carefully open the card. It is not easy, because the battery blocks the cap. Try to force 
a thin piece of plasitc (or your finger nail) between the two pieces of the case.
After successfully open it, it is recommended to cut a piece of plastic out of the cap 
(see picture), opposite to the battery. So that it will open easier the next time.
Check if you have the right hardware: big 'V2' sign on the lower right, above that the 
16M Flash from Macronix and left of that the Bung ASIC GBX-01.
Now remove the 16M Flash, it is replaced with a Intel 28F640J5, 64Mbit device. Do not take 
another device, because the programming software recognise this type. It is the best to use 
a special "hot air" SMD remove solder iron. If ou do not have access to one, bend every 
single pin carefully up (with help of a needle) by heating it. Be careful and do not lift 
the pads !
The 16M datasheet could be found here: www.macronix.com
The Flash datasheet could be found here:
http://developer.intel.com/design/flcomp/datashts/290606.htm

As far as I know, there is only this Flash out there with this pinning, you
can NOT use another ! Beside this, FLASH ID will differ and the progrmming
software will not recognise the other device !
DO NOT TAKE THE TSSOP DEVICE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SOLDER THE THIN PINS !

This article describes the replacemet of the macronix 29F1610 Flash device with a Intel 28F640J5
Flash device. If there is an other Flash device in the 16M card, the replacement may also work, 
but you have to figure out the connections yourself.
The technique to do the wireing is the same used for the MBC5 card.
Connect a 0.2 mm copper wire to every pad and lead them to the upper or lower side for about 3 cm.
Refer to picture ?, the datasheets and the table (GB connector points to you, battery and RAM is 
on the upper side. 
Macronix use the 16bit way to name the address lines, do not be desturbed that there is always a
difference of one (GB A(1) <-> MX A(0)).
You have to be very experienced in soldering, because some copper wires have to be fixed to the 
Bung ASIC pins ! Be attentive to put no solder tin across two pins !

Pin 62 of the Bung GBX-01 should be connected to GND. Cut this connection carefully with a sharp
knife. Connect pin 61 with a 0.2 mm copper wire (see above) to GND.

Put adhensive textil tape with the size of the MX Flash above the wires, so that the pads are 
covered from it. Bend all pins of the Flash straight, see picture ? 2..
Take some thicker wire (e.g. from resistor) and solder one to pad 44  pionting to right and 
another one to pin 16 of the RAM pointing down (refer to picture). These are used as a base 
to fix the device. Cut them carefully and do not lift the pads. Solder them to pin 56 and 29 of 
the Flash. Now connect all wires to the appropriate signal. Use a ohm meter to find the right 
one, keep the lines short. Below the dashed line are additional connestions that have to be made 
to the Flash. Try to keep the VCC/GND (14, 28, 44) lines as short as possible.
Pin 62 of the Bung GBX-01 should be connected to GND. Cut this connection carefully with a sharp 
knife. Connect pin 61 with a 0.2 mm copper wire (see above) to GND.
Check if there are 5 new connestions to the ASIC.
Thats it, now our cartridge must look like this one on the picture ......and should work !
Your most preferred Flashprogram should recognise it as a 64M card.
