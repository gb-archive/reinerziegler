Modification of a MBC5 Cardridge
================================

Search for GB Color Games with save option. 64kbit or 256kbit will fit the
needs. I took a cheap NBC Pro 99 cardridge (8Mbit ROM, 64kbit RAM).
DISCONNECT THE BATTERY FIRST !
To exchange a 256kbit RAM is not necessary but recommended, because more and
more new games are out there which use more than 256kbit RAM.
To remove the RAM and ROM it is the best to use a special "hot air" SMD 
remove solder iron. If you do not have access to one, bend every single pin 
carefully up (with help of a needle) by heating it. 
Be careful and do not lift the pads !

The RAMs used here are standard devices, find the datasheets here:

http://www.usa.samsungsemi.com/products/newsummary/powersram/K6T0808C1D.htm
http://www.hitachi.co.jp/Sicd/English/Products/memorye.htm
Other suppliers also have these RAMs, the name of the types may differ from
these above. Check datasheets for the same pinning.
The Flash datasheet could be found here:
http://developer.intel.com/design/flcomp/datashts/290606.htm

As far as I know, there is only this Flash out there with this pinning, you
can NOT use another ! Beside this, FLASH ID will differ and the progrmming
software will not recognise the other device !
DO NOT TAKE THE TSSOP DEVICE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SOLDER THE THIN PINS !

Bend the pins of the 1Mbit SRAM towards the case (see picture 1.). Nearly all 
pins will fit to the pads on the PCB, except the following:
1(NC), 2(A16), 28(A13), 29(WE#), 30(CS2), 31(A15), 32(VCC)
Bend these straight (see picture 2.) then solder the IC to the pads. Pins 16 
and 17 should touch the former pins 14 and 15. Pins 1, 2, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 
should not touch the PCB and should not be soldered at this time. Check if there 
is a connection on the PCB from the former RAM pin 1 to the MBC5 pin 28 (RAM A14).
256kbit cartridges should have these connection, 64kbit not.
Next connect the open pins to the appropriate signal. The best is to use 0.2mm 
copper wire with varnish insulation (used in transformers). The insulation varnish 
can be easy removed by heating the wire with the solder iron and then put solder 
tin on it, as long as you can see that the solder tin burns the varnish away.
Make the follwoing connections:
RAM pin
   1     not connected, not used
   2     MBC pin 26 (RAM A16)
 ( 3     MBC pin 28 (RAM A14) see above, if there is a connection, leave this out)
  28     MBC pin 29 (RAM A13)
  29     MBC pin 30 (RAM WR#)
  30     MM1134 pin 3 
  31     MBC pin 27 (RAM A15)
  32     C3 nearby leads VCC, pick up from there

That was the easy part ! 

Now the ROM is exchanged with a Flash device. You can take every device from 8Mbit 
uwards, but the Intel 32Mbit/64Mbit (28F320J5/28F640J5) device is preferred, because 
some programming software recognise this type. This articel describes the insertion 
of the 28F640J5 type in conjunction with the use of the BUNG ExChanger (V2) programmer
to program the cartridge. OTHER COMBINATIONS ARE NOT TESTED !
Much soldering experience is recommended for this modification !
Flash datasheet could be found here: 28F320J5, 28F640J5
ROM pin view could be found here: 8Mbit ROM.
The orientation on the PCB is like the RAM (cartridge connector points towards you, the
MBC5 and the battery is on the upper side), pin 1 points to the left upper side.
Connect a 0.2 mm copper wire (see above) to every pad and lead them to the right or left
side for about 3 cm. Refer to picture ?, the datasheets and the table.

Put adhensive textil tape with the size of the ROM above the wires, so that the pads are
covered from it. Bend all pins of the Flash straight, see picture ? 2..
Take some thicker wire (e.g. from resistor) and solder one on the lower end of C2 (VCC)
pionting to right and another one at the lower left, 5mm above pin 32 (GND) to the GND 
plane pointing left (refer to picture). These are used as a base to fix the device. 
Solder them to pin 56 and 29 of the Flash. Now connect all wires to the appropriate 
signal. Use a ohm meter to find the right one, keep the lines short. Below the dashed 
line are additional connestions that have to be made to the Flash. Try to keep the 
VCC/GND (14, 28, 44) lines as short as possible.
Thats it, now our cartridge must look like this one on the picture .... and should work!

SOME OTHER PROGRAMMING HARDWARE MAY USE AN OTHER WRITE LINE THAN THE AUDIO (CARTRIDGE
PIN 31). YOU MUST CHANGE THIS IN THAT CASE !
The BUNG programmer ALWAYS use the audio line (cartridge pin 31) to write the Flash 
device !
