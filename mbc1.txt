  MBC1 has two different maximum memory modes:
  16Mbit ROM/8KByte RAM  or  4Mbit ROM/32KByte RAM.

  The MBC1 defaults to 16Mbit ROM/8KByte RAM mode
  on power up. Writing a value (XXXXXXXS - X = Don't
  care, S = Memory model select) into 6000-7FFF area
  will select the memory model to use. S = 0 selects
  16/8 mode. S = 1 selects 4/32 mode.

  Writing a value (XXXBBBBB - X = Don't cares, B =
  bank select bits) into 2000-3FFF area will select an
  appropriate ROM bank at 4000-7FFF. Values of 0 and 1
  do the same thing and point to ROM bank 1. Rom bank 0
  is not accessible from 4000-7FFF and can only be read
  from 0000-3FFF.

  If memory model is set to 4/32:
  Writing a value (XXXXXXBB - X = Don't care, B =
  bank select bits) into 4000-5FFF area will select an
  appropriate RAM bank at A000-C000. Before you can
  read or write to a RAM bank you have to enable it by
  writing a XXXX1010 into 0000-1FFF area. To disable
  RAM bank operations write any value but XXXX1010
  into 0000-1FFF area. Disabling a RAM bank probably
  protects that bank from false writes during power
  down of the GameBoy. (NOTE: Nintendo suggests values
  $0A to enable and $00 to disable RAM bank!!)

  If memory model is set to 16/8 mode:
  Writing a value (XXXXXXBB - X = Don't care, B =
  bank select bits) into 4000-5FFF area will set the
  two most significant ROM address lines.
